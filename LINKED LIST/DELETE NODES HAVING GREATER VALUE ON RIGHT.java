Delete nodes having greater value on right 
Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes which have a greater value on its following nodes.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15 11 6 3
Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are
the elements which have greater elements
on their next node. So, after deleting
them, the linked list would like be 15,
11, 6, 3.
